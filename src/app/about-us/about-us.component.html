    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    In a project on behalf of our studies, students of industrial engineering and management at Azrieli College, have developed a website that will serve you as a forecasting tool.
    <br>
Using this tool any user who has a vision for the project will be able to enter the required project characteristics according to the template and get feedback.
<br>
The template will show him a measure of the success of the project and allow him to consider steps.
<br>
Every project matters and our goal is to create a path of self-confidence and help fulfill the vision of the initiators.
<br>
<br>
Work levels:
<br>
1. Introducing the required characteristics of the project: Main Category, Sub Category, Currency, Duration, Country and Goal
<br>
2. Waiting for feedback
<br>
3. Set out with self-belief!
